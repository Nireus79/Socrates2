## Quick Interconnection Map

```
Phase 0 (Docs) → Phase 1 (Infrastructure) → Phase 2 (3 Agents) → Phase 3 (Conflicts) → Phase 4 (Code Gen) → Phase 5 (Quality)
                       ↓                           ↓                      ↓                   ↓                  ↓
                   BaseAgent                  Workflow:          Real-time          Maturity Gate       Prevents
                   Orchestrator            Ask → Answer       Contradiction       Blocks <100%        Greedy
                   Database                 → Extract           Detection                            Decisions
                                            → Save
```

## Critical Path (Minimum Viable Product)

**MVP = Phases 0-4**

1. ✅ **Phase 0:** Documentation (current) - 100%
2. ⏳ **Phase 1:** Infrastructure - Database + Auth + BaseAgent
3. ⏳ **Phase 2:** Core Agents - Socratic questioning works
4. ⏳ **Phase 3:** Conflicts - Detects contradictions
5. ⏳ **Phase 4:** Code Generation - Generates code at maturity

**After MVP:**
- Phase 5: Quality Control (highly recommended)
- Phases 6-10: Advanced features

---

## Verification Gates (MANDATORY)

**Cannot proceed to next phase until:**

### Phase 0 → Phase 1
- [ ] All documentation complete
- [ ] User reviewed and approved
- [ ] Architecture clear
- [ ] No ambiguities

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
- [ ] Database connects
- [ ] Users can authenticate
- [ ] BaseAgent instantiates
- [ ] Orchestrator routes
- [ ] Tests pass 100%

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
- [ ] Can create project
- [ ] Can generate question
- [ ] Can extract specs
- [ ] Specs save to database
- [ ] Integration test passes

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
- [ ] Conflicts detected
- [ ] User can resolve
- [ ] Specs only save if no conflict
- [ ] Tests with contradictions pass

### Phase 4 → Phase 5
- [ ] Code generation works
- [ ] Maturity gate blocks <100%
- [ ] Generated code valid
- [ ] Tests pass

## Key Dependencies

| Phase | Depends On | Provides To |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | Archive analysis | All phases (docs) |
| 1 | Phase 0 docs | Phase 2 (infrastructure) |
| 2 | Phase 1 infra | Phase 3 (agents + workflow) |
| 3 | Phase 2 spec extraction | Phase 4 (conflict-free specs) |
| 4 | Phase 3 specs | Phase 5 (code generation) |
| 5 | Phase 4 generation | All (quality gates) |

---

## Success Criteria (Each Phase)

✅ **Phase Complete When:**
1. All deliverables created
2. All tests pass (≥90% coverage)
3. Verification checklist 100%
4. Integration test passes
5. No known bugs
6. User approved

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Repeat archive failures | Follow anti-pattern rules strictly |
| Scope creep | Verification gates prevent moving forward |
| Missing interconnections | Every component documents dependencies |
| Silent failures | No fallbacks, fail fast |
| Technical debt | Tests mandatory before proceeding |
