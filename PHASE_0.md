# Phase 0: Documentation & Planning

**Status:** ✅ IN PROGRESS
**Duration:** Current phase
**Goal:** Complete documentation before any coding begins

---

## 📋 Objectives

1. Document all patterns from archive (good and bad)
2. Define complete architecture
3. Create detailed phase-by-phase plan
4. Define testing strategy
5. Establish verification gates

---

## 📦 Deliverables

### Core Documentation
- [x] README.md - Project overview
- [x] INTERCONNECTIONS_MAP.md - Master interconnection document
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture
- [ ] PHASE_0.md through PHASE_10.md - Individual phase plans
- [ ] PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md - Directory layout
- [ ] TESTING_STRATEGY.md - Test requirements
- [ ] DATABASE_SCHEMA.md - Complete database design

### Archive Analysis
- [ ] ARCHIVE_PATTERNS.md - Good patterns to follow
- [ ] ARCHIVE_ANTIPATTERNS.md - Anti-patterns to avoid
- [ ] WHY_PREVIOUS_ATTEMPTS_FAILED.md - Failure analysis
- [ ] LESSONS_LEARNED.md - Key takeaways

### Reference Documents
- [ ] DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md - Coding standards
- [ ] VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md - Phase verification checklist
- [ ] API_SPECIFICATION.md - API endpoint design
- [ ] DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md - How to deploy (future)

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

**Depends On:**
- Old Socrates repository (reference only)
- Archive analysis (completed)

**Provides To:**
- Phase 1 (Infrastructure implementation)
- All future phases (reference documentation)

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before proceeding to Phase 1, ALL of these must be complete:

### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] All phase documents (0-10) created
- [ ] Each phase document includes:
  - [ ] Objectives
  - [ ] Dependencies (what it needs from previous phases)
  - [ ] Deliverables (what it provides to next phases)
  - [ ] Detailed implementation steps
  - [ ] Test requirements
  - [ ] Verification checklist
  - [ ] Interconnections clearly defined

### Architecture Clarity
- [ ] Component diagram created
- [ ] Data flow documented
- [ ] Database schema finalized
- [ ] API endpoints defined
- [ ] Agent responsibilities clear

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test requirements for each phase defined
- [ ] Test file structure planned
- [ ] Integration test scenarios documented
- [ ] Verification gates established

### Review Process
- [ ] User reviewed all documentation
- [ ] Identified gaps addressed
- [ ] Architecture approved
- [ ] Phase plan approved
- [ ] Ready to start Phase 1

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Phase 0 is complete when:
1. ✅ All documentation files created
2. ✅ User reviewed and approved all docs
3. ✅ No ambiguities or missing information
4. ✅ Clear path forward for Phase 1
5. ✅ Verification checklist above is 100% complete

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. Create all phase documents (PHASE_1.md through PHASE_10.md)
2. Create architecture document (ARCHITECTURE.md)
3. Create archive analysis documents
4. Create testing strategy
5. User review
6. Address feedback
7. Final approval → Move to Phase 1
